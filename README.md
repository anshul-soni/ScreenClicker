# ScreenClicker

I made this when valve launched their summer sale monster clicker game. 
I just wanted to get high score in the game without actually playing it to get the discounts.

Run the program
Enter the time you want the clicker to go on for
Point the mouse to the position where you want the click to occur
and press control
Dont click, just press control
Do that for every point you want to be clicked
Press s to start clicking
Once you start the program you wont be able to control the mouse.
To stop the program anytime press escape.

Comment line 68-76 to make the program click where you point instead of saving the positions
That would let you move the mouse around instead of fixing the mouse positions

If you comment those line
to run the program enter the time 
and then press s
No need to save the points

Note:If you are a programmer you can experiment with sleep time in line 78 as different application can take take different number of cps, and a low value crashes applications.
